# Threshold-Based Relative Probability Ratio Profiles

This repository contains the complete set of figures illustrating the **Relative Probability Ratio (RPR)** between health outcomes and physical activity (PA) features. These profiles support the findings reported in the manuscript:

**"Cross-Study Evaluation of Step-Derived Physical Activity Metrics and Health Outcomes in NHANES and UK Biobank"**

## Repository Structure

Figures are organized for ease of exploration by **sex group**, and further grouped by:
- **PA Feature** (e.g., activity, age, npa, sum)
- **Health Outcome** (e.g., stroke, diabetes, hypertension)

## Notes

- RPR curves compare NHANES and UK Biobank cohorts.
- Sex-stratified results are provided in separate folders.
- Figures illustrate threshold-based associations discussed in the manuscript.
